# Project Description

Welcome to my Twitter Clone project! 🐦

I'm excited to share with you my first React Native project, where I aim to practice and enhance my skills in building mobile applications. This project is specifically focused on creating a Twitter-like app using Expo for development.

Although this is a simplified version, I'm striving to create a visually appealing user interface with dummy data. Please note that there won't be any user registration or authentication functionality implemented at this stage.

Feel free to explore and interact with the app as a visitor. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy coding! 😊
